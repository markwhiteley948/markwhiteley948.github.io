<h2>Step 1: Steam Your Milk</h2>

    <h3>The first step to make your perfect latte is to grab your milk of choice and get it ready to be steamed.</h3>
</center>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick your favorite milk and pour the desired amount into a steam pitcher.<br><i>(Keep in mind the milk will aerate and grow in volume a bit.)</i></li>
        <li>Now, purge your steam wand of any water built up inside </li>
        <li>Place the wand slightly below the surface of the milk at a slight angle and to one side of the pitcher.</li>
        <li>Turn on the steam wand and barely lower your pitcher to allow the wand to <q>kiss</q> the surface and allow some air in.</li>
        <li>Submerge the wand below the surface and try to create a whirlpool with the milk.</li>
        <li>Continue to steam the milk until you reach a temperature of <b>140-160 &#xb0;F.</b></li>
        <li>Tap the milk pictcher a few times on the counter to get rid of any bubbles that are too large.<br>(Your milk should look like glossy paint.)</li>
    </ul>
<center><p>You can now continue to making the espresso.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare Your Shot</h2>

    <h3>Once your milk is finished, it's time to prepare your espresso.</h3>
</center>
    <ul>
        <li>Place your portafilter under the grinder.</li>
        <li>Dose <b>18-20 grams</b> of espresso into the portafilter basket</li>
        <li>Tamp the espresso down using approximately <b>30 lbs</b> of pressure.</li>
        <li>Take the portafilter and attach it to the grouphead.</li>
    </ul>
    <center><p>Now you are ready to pull your shot!</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Pull Your Shot</h2>
    <p><img src="shot_pouring.jpg" alt="Espresso pouring out of machine" width="960" height="540"></p>
    <h3>Now you need to pull your shot and make sure it is within parameters and is up to standards.</h3>
</center>
<ul>
    <li>Once your portafilter is secured into the goruphead,<br>you can press the double shot button on the machine.</li>
    <li>Your shot will start to pull, starting as a darker color and slowly becoming a light tan color.</li>
    <li>The espresso should look like warm honey pouring off a spoon.<br><i>(If it is too fast your grind may have been too course or your tamp may not have been heavy enough.<br>If the espresso trickles out very slowly you may have tamped too hard or your grind may have been too fine.)</i></li>
    <li>The shot should have pulled between <b>22-28 seconds</b> in order to be up to standards</li>
    <li>Pour the shot into a little bit of the milk or syrup in order to save it and prevent a bitter shot.</li>
</ul>
<center><p>You are ready for the final step in preparing your latte!</p>

<h2>Step 4: Pour Your Milk into the Espresso.</h2>

    <h3>This last step can be as simple or as adnvanced as you would like.</h3>
<p>If you want to do it simply, all you have to do is grab your cup and pour the milk straight into the espresso and you are finished!</p>
