    <p><h2>MY EXPERIENCE WITH CODING A WEBSITE</h2></p>

    <div class="blog">
        <p>Before taking this course, I had very little experience with coding. I had taken a class at another institution back in 2019 where we were assigned a project that involved editing a pre-existing code, however that is much different than coding from scratch. I was eager to learn how to code in this class, but also a bit intimidated. When we started with the beginning steps to creating an index.html, I was worried it may take some time to get used to the process. With the help of free code camp though, I was able to learn how to code in a way that made it fairly easy to me. Although I do not feel completely confident in my coding skills, I feel like I have improved a lot. I really enjoyed getting to learn and work on css because I am much more intrigued by the visuals of a website than the back-end development part of it. Getting to create a website completely built by me, from nothing, was very rewarding and a great opportunity. Personalizing a website that could be about something that was interesting to me and looks the way I want it too was amazing to me and I canâ€™t wait to learn more about coding html and css in future courses.  </p>
