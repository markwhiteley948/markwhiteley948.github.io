        <p><h2>MY EXPERIENCE WITH WORDPRESS</h2></p>
    
        <div class="blog">
            <p>WordPress was the form of website design I was the most familiar with coming into this class. I had used it in high school, as well as in some other classes here at Boise State. Although I have had experience with WordPress, it is definitely not my favorite site to work with. I find the block options to be a bit restricting and it is difficult getting things to go into the spot you want them to be exactly. I will say though, WordPress is a great option for creating a portfolio or blog type website as it offers blocks and widgets that make the process of uploading content to be fairly simple and straightforward. Through this project of creating a media portfolio on WordPress I feel like I have finally gotten to the point where I am able to work with the quirks of the website and make it work with me. In the future, especially in school, I am sure I will have to use WordPress again, but if I were to one day build a website of my own I dont think it would be my first choice.</p>
        <h2>MY BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS</h2>
    
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Be patient with WordPress.</li>
            <li>Play around with the different blocks and wwidgets to get familiar with them and figure out how to best use them.</li>
            <li>This design site is great for creating portfolios or blogs.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><h2>MY EXPERIENCE WITH SQUARESPACE</h2></p>

        <div class="blog">
            <p>With Squarespace, I had heard about it quite a bit because it is highly advertised in a lot of media I consume. It seems as though every podcast I listen to has partnered with them. Now I understand why so many of these influencers promote and use this website themselves. After working on WordPress, the transition to Squarespace was great. I found Squarespace to be very easy to use and navigate. It is a great website to use for aesthetics and sleek design and offers so many different tools to create a super cohesive website. This assignment I decided to create a website for a fake coffee shop I made up in a past class, and I think it turned out amazing, and i didnt even use every aspect of the tools to my advantage. On Squarespace you can design everything from your icon that shows on the tab and the “404 Not Found” page which I thought was super cool. Squarespcae will definitely be my choice of web design website if I ever need a website in the future and don't want to code it from scratch.
